# My Excel Projects

## Project 1: Salary Dashboard  
In that project, I created a salary dashboard based on [this dataset](/Project_1-Dashboard/1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx). It shows the job salaries based on the country and specific data job.

That is the preview of the Excel project. You may select a different job title, such as `Machine Learning Engineer` or `Senior Data Scientist`. You may also select the job country, for example, `United States` or `United Kingdom`. In the third part, you can also select a different job working type, such as `Full time` or `Part time`. After selection, the graphs will be updated automatically.  
In this project, I used basic Excel skills such as Charts, Formulas, and Data Validations.  

## Project 2: Salary Analysis  
In this project, I used the [Excel dataset](/Project_2-Analysis/1_Project_Analysis.xlsx) with some advanced Excel functions and operations such as `Data Models`, `Power Query`, `Pivot Tables`, and `DAX`. 
That is the preview of the result:
